Before running client or server, do the following:

    $ make
    $ . setenv.sh

Now, if you have IceJS properly installed, you can launch the server
with one of the following commands (both should work):

    $ ./server.js
    $ node server.js

And the server, in other terminal (after doing the upper setup),
using one of the following:

    $ ./client.js
    $ node client.js
