This is an "bidir" JavaScript example. It is a trivial adaptation/simplification of
[1] to our Printer interface.

This example shows invocation from browser to standard Ice Server (C++, Python, ...)
and viceversa.

Procedure:

- Install DEPENDS
- Run a "bidir" server
- Execute "make run-client"
- Click "Start"
